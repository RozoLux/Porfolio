                Welcome!

                Iâ€™m Johann Levert, a Full Stack Developer with a rich background in the insurance sector. After achieving numerous milestones in insurance, I am now channeling my analytical prowess and problem-solving skills into the world of software development. With a solid foundation in data analysis, process optimization, and relationship management, I'm eager to contribute to and grow alongside an innovative IT team.

                {/* **Journey from Insurance to Information Technology** */}

                My career in insurance honed my analytical skills, understanding of complex processes, and the ability to maintain client relationships under pressure. These experiences laid a strong foundation for my transition into software development, where I bring a unique perspective to data analysis and process optimization. <br />

                My venture into Full Stack Web and Mobile Development, alongside Backend and DevOps, has been marked by rigorous training and hands-on projects that have prepared me to tackle challenges in the tech industry head-on.
